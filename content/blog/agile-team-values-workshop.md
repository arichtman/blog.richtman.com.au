## About

This is a 3-part workshop, designed to be used to revitalize or initialize an agile team, honing in and crystalizing some of the team's values.
The structure draws from Double-Diamond/Converge-Diverge, and the style is task-oriented.
The minimum number of participants is four, and participants should be able to take turns at leading the activities.

The workshop should fit in a half day with minimal breaks, or can be spaced out over a full day with longer pauses.

The sessions are designed to be able to run in-person, remotely, or hybrid.
The default plan assumes in-person, where adjustments are required for remote there are notes.

## Session A: Introduction

Aims:

- Get brains engaged, coffees finished, weekend banter finished
- Allow for late comers
- Initiate train of thought for subsequent workshops

Timing: 45 - 60 minutes

Materials:

- Blank paper or whiteboards
- Colored pencils or markers
- Erasers or paper towel
- Prints of each set of instructions for each pair
- (remote) Digital sketchboard app

Procedure:

1. Introduce the theme and activity.
   - Agile is fundamentally simple, do what works, more...and do what _doesn't_ work, less.
      How do we do that? Well the big focus is tightening feedback loops, and adjusting rapidly.
      We still actually undertake similar rounds and activities as waterfall, just faster and with more change.
   - Today we're going to do maximum Agile.
      We're going to do the development cycle, 5 minutes at a time.
      One of you will be the client, with requirements, the other will be the agile builders.
      We'll complete 3 cycles, pause to review, then swap and repeat with different requirements.
1. Pair off the participants and have them nominate a class/category for each person in the pair.
   This can be who takes a train on their commute, prefers wind instruments to percussion, etc, anything.
1. Hand out any equipment and explain the details of the activity, now that people know which role they will be first.
   - Clients: you will build a base of requirements by answering your builder's questions.
     As you answer their questions, make notes to keep track of the requirements you have made.
     You may make notes during any phase, includingboth to capture requirements you just made, as well as to make requirements for the next phase.
     Your requirements will unfold more each cycle as you are further interrogated by your builder.
     You will be responsible for keeping your builders to the schedule.
     How to score will be on your requirements cards, it is completely subjective and deliberately simple.
     If you need inspiration, think of a famous movie character or favorite celebrity and assume their persona.
   - Builders: your phases are; gather requirements, plan, build.
     You may only ask questions during the requirements phase.
     You may only use the eraser during the plan phase.
     You may only use the pencils/draw during the build phase.
     You may make notes at any phase.
     Each sprint, one phase will be 2 minutes, and the others 1 minute.
     You must nominate which phase will be the long one before each cycle commences.
   - Scoring is at the end of each cycle and is entirely subjective.
     +2 means they met all your requirements satisfactorily, 1 means not all requirements or not satisfactory, 0 is anything less than that.
     You should have 1 score for each cycle, making the maximum score overall 6 and the minimum score 0.
     After the client scores the builder, share the score and any missed requirements from the drawing.
1. Conclude with a discussion of how it felt to change the phase timing, and what felt best or worse.

## Session B: What's a team do?

Aims:

- Enumerate and collectively prioritize team activities

Timing: 45 - 60 minutes

Materials:

- Whiteboard or digital board
- Individual pen and paper or notetaking apparatus
- Voting props.
  Table tennis paddles or similar, can be made out of cardboard and paddle pop sticks...
  For online it depends on your video call software, many support emoji reactions but you can fall back to hand signals.

Method:

1. Individual brainstorming, timed, 5 minutes.
   Topic: What are the activities that a team undertakes?
   These can be individually, collectively, formally, and informally, planned and unplanned.
   Totally unique answers - 4 points, totally unanimous answers - 1 point.
1. Everyone puts their answers up on the board in a column under their name, 5 minutes.
1. When those are up, we score together, 10 minutes.
   Some answers will be very similar, sudden death vote decides if it's same or unique.
   Any unique answer can be contested by anyone, decided by sudden death vote if it's allowed or disqualified.
1. Speed stack ranking, loosely timed, 7-10 minutes.
   If doing this physically on a whiteboard, leave plenty of space between things so you don't have to erase and rewrite constantly.
   Everyone gets a voting prop, one side indicating up and the other down.
   Fun ideas include; P1/"Next sprint", Mario 1up/mushrooms.
   Starting at the *most common*/*lowest* scoring entries, the emcee pulls them out into a stack and the crowd speed votes until the placement stabilizes.
   Continue up the answers towards the most unique until time runs out.
1. Conclude with a plenary review of the ranking.
   Which were the most contentious?
   Were there any upsets?
   Which one didn't get justice?

## Session C: Lead into Gold

Aims:

- Discover and assert some of what we value as a team

Timing: 60+ minutes

Materials:

- Whiteboard or digital board
- Individual pen and paper or notetaking apparatus

Method:

1. Pair exploration, loosely timed, 10 minutes+.
   Split into pairs, different partner to last time.
   Each group gets the same listings, a selected variety of 5 from the stack ranking (avoid anything too similar).
   Depending on the style of things that made the leader board, choose two questions.
   For each item;
   - What does good/good execution look like?
   - What makes the output/impact "good"?
   - What are the most important inputs and conditions? What leads to us getting what we want *out* of this activity?
   - What are the critical outputs? What does the team want from this activity, or why would they undertake it?
1. Plenary sharing.
   Put the 5 things on the left side and take turns sharing what we selected as important or not and why.
   As things are shared, put them horizontally across in sort-of swim lanes.
1. Coalesce:
   - Activity options:
     - In your pairs, what are some common themes or values we see across these?
     - Everyone come up to the board and circle anything that really stands out for you.
   - Examples:
     - Top-down clarity of vision
     - Bottom-up growth based on immediate needs
     - Well-planned and structured work
     - Deciding what we need in the moment in collaboration
     - Large chunks of work with big payoffs
     - Smaller iterative improvements
     - Risky changes and ideas
     - Conservative but tried and tested approaches
1. Sharing: As the teams share, we should be able to draw some vertical "threads" that cross the swim lanes.
   Alternatively, label some of the highlighted themes and note the group they collectively form.
   Maybe 3 of the 5 have collaboration or documentation as key factors.
   Or there's a clustering around openness, transparency, feedback, and honesty.
1. Conclude: As a team, agree on at least 3 we-prefer-this-over-this, Agile-style values.
   Maybe make a catchy tag line, acronym, or short team maxim.
