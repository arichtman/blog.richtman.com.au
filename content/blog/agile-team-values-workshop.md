## About

This is a 3-part workshop, designed to be used to revitalize or initialize an agile team, honing in and crystalizing some of the team's values.
The structure draws from Double-Diamond/Converge-Diverge, and the style is task-oriented.
The minimum number of participants is four, and participants should be able to take turns at leading the activities.

The workshop should fit in a half day with minimal breaks, or can be spaced out over a full day with longer pauses.

The sessions are designed to be able to run in-person, remotely, or hybrid.
The default plan assumes in-person, where adjustments are required for remote there are notes.

Details of the exercises are contained in the appendix.

## Session A: Introduction

Aims:

- Get brains engaged, coffees finished, weekend banter finished
- Allow for late comers
- Initiate train of thought for subsequent workshops

Timing: 45 - 60 minutes

Materials:

- Blank paper or whiteboards
- Colored pencils or markers
- Erasers or paper towel
- Prints of each set of instructions for each pair
- (remote) Digital sketchboard app

Procedure:

1. Introduce the theme and activity.
1. Pair off the participants and have them nominate a class/category for each person in the pair.
   This can be who takes a train on their commute, prefers wind instruments to percussion, etc, anything.
1. Run the activity.
1. Conclude with a discussion of how it felt to change the phase timing, and what felt best or worse.

## Session B: What's a team do?

Aims:

- Enumerate and collectively prioritize team activities

Timing: 45 - 60 minutes

Materials:

- Whiteboard or digital board
- Individual pen and paper or notetaking apparatus
- Voting props.
  Table tennis paddles or similar, can be made out of cardboard and paddle pop sticks...
  For online it depends on your video call software, many support emoji reactions but you can fall back to hand signals.

Method:

1. Individual brainstorming, timed, 5 minutes.
   Topic: What are the activities that a team undertakes?
   These can be individually, collectively, formally, and informally, planned and unplanned.
   Totally unique answers - 4 points, totally unanimous answers - 1 point.
1. Everyone puts their answers up on the board in a column under their name, 5 minutes.
1. When those are up, we score together, 10 minutes.
   Some answers will be very similar, sudden death vote decides if it's same or unique.
   Any unique answer can be contested by anyone, decided by sudden death vote if it's allowed or disqualified.
1. Speed stack ranking, loosely timed, 7-10 minutes.
   If doing this physically on a whiteboard, leave plenty of space between things so you don't have to erase and rewrite constantly.
   Everyone gets a voting prop, one side indicating up and the other down.
   Fun ideas include; P1/"Next sprint", Mario 1up/mushrooms.
   Starting at the *most common*/*lowest* scoring entries, the emcee pulls them out into a stack and the crowd speed votes until the placement stabilizes.
   Continue up the answers towards the most unique until time runs out.
1. Conclude with a plenary review of the ranking.
   Which were the most contentious?
   Were there any upsets?
   Which one didn't get justice?

## Session C: Lead into Gold

Aims:

- Discover and assert some of what we value as a team

Timing: 60+ minutes

Materials:

- Whiteboard or digital board
- Individual pen and paper or notetaking apparatus

Method:

1. Pair exploration, loosely timed, 10 minutes+.
   Split into pairs, different partner to last time.
   Each group gets the same listings, a selected variety of 5 from the stack ranking (avoid anything too similar).
   For each item;
   - What does good/good execution look like?
   - What makes the output/impact "good"?
   - What are the most important inputs and conditions?
1. Plenary sharing.
   Put the 5 things on the left side and take turns sharing what we selected as important or not and why.
   As things are shared, put them horizontally across in sort-of swim lanes.
1. Coalesce: In your pairs, what are some common themes or values we see across these?
   Examples:
   - Top-down clarity of vision
   - Bottom-up growth based on immediate needs
   - Well-planned and structured work
   - Deciding what we need in the moment in collaboration
   - Large chunks of work with big payoffs
   - Smaller iterative improvements
   - Risky changes and ideas
   - Conservative but tried and tested approaches
1. Sharing: As the teams share, we should be able to draw some vertical "threads" that cross the swim lanes.
   Maybe 3 of the 5 have collaboration or documentation as key factors.
1. Conclude: As a team, agree on at least 3 we-prefer-this-over-this, Agile-style values.
   Maybe make a catchy tag line, acronym, or short team maxim.

### Session A Details

Introduction:

Agile is fundamentally simple, do what works, more...and do what _doesn't_ work, less.
How do we do that? Well the big focus is tightening feedback loops, and adjusting rapidly.
We still actually undertake similar rounds and activities as waterfall, just faster and with more change.

Today we're going to do maximum Agile.
We're going to do the development cycle, 5 minutes at a time.
One of you will be the client, with requirements, the other will be the agile builders.
We'll complete 3 cycles, pause to review, then swap and repeat with different requirements.

Clients: you are allowed to answer questions but only minimally and what has been directly asked.
Do not volunteer any additional information.
Your requirements will unfold more each cycle.
You many only answer questions during the requirements phase, but you may make notes during any of the phases.
For any cycle, you may answer using all the information from prior cycles and including the current one.
For example, in cycle one you may only answer using cycle 1 information, in cycle 2, you may answer using cycle 1 *and* cycle 2 information, etc for cycle 3.
You will be responsible for keeping your builders to the schedule.
How to score will be on your requirements cards.

Builders: your phases are; gather requirements, plan, build.
You may only ask questions during the requirements phase.
Each sprint, one phase will be 2 minutes, and the others 1 minute.
You must nominate which phase will be the long one before each cycle commences.

Client Alice:

Scoring is at the end of each round and is entirely subjective.
+2 means they met all your requirements satisfactorily, 1 means not all requirements or not satisfactory, 0 is anything less than that.
You should have 1 score for each cycle, making the maximum score overall 6 and the minimum score 0.
You should let your builder know what score they got when you decide.

Cycle 1:

- You only stay there temporarily.
- You stay with your partner and your pets.

Cycle 2:

- Your temporary stay is over winters.
- You like to host while you're staying there.
- Your pet is a pair of dogs.

Cycle 3:

- You're really into snowboarding.
- Your dogs are elderly, not very mobile and don't see well.

Client Bob:

Scoring is at the end of each round and is entirely subjective.
+2 means they met all your requirements satisfactorily, 1 means not all requirements or not satisfactory, 0 is anything less than that.
You should have 1 score for each cycle, making the maximum score overall 6 and the minimum score 0.
You should let your builder know what score they got when you decide.

Cycle 1:

- You live there full time.
- You live with your large family.

Cycle 2:

- Your grandparents live with you, but they like their own space.
  They listen to international TV and radio very loudly at all times.

Cycle 3:

- You have 5 daughters, 2 of which are married.
