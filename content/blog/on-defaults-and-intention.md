# On Defaults and Intention

I've been travelling recently, and while I don't consider myself a polyglot I've dabbled in French, Indonesian, Italian, Thai, Japanese, Hebrew, Spanish, and more[^1].
In communicating across cultural and language barriers, intent seems really the core of the transmission, to put it in terms I suppose I understand[^2].
Plenty can be communicated by context alone, a surprising amount by mime, and most of the rest by pantomime.

Well, "most of the rest" is carrying a lot of weight here, right?
I mean how much is "the rest" of a nuanced social interaction that may include; reaction to a diagnosis, a specific hotel destination, an allergic or dietary requirement.

Which got me thinking about ~ of all things ~, our process of purchasing[^3] a house.

Sparing details of the search, we did very limited research on the process.
We found something we knew we wanted, and we agreed.

Subsequently, the process went:

- We signaled the intent
- Everything else carried us through

To be clear: **Everything else carried us through**

From lawyers and conveyancers to titles and deeds, I couldn't tell you anything about what does what or why.
We signaled intent, and from there were guided by the options provided by the involved institutions.

Which, if I squint at it, seems to echo my international communication.
Many times I find my vocabulary or grammar lacking, but cobbling together a few geustures and some vocabulary signals enough intent that I'm able to be channelled into a funnel of intention.
From there, people who are willing to help (and the generally are, IME), have a much clearer pool of known options to offer you, or to narrow you into from your requirements.
Even if they haven't interacted with you or your specific request before, the intention provides context and a framework for them to guide you with.

I suppose what I'm saying is:

- Many worn paths doesn't mean you won't find support
- Don't let self-doubt in capability stop you from attempting something

[^1]: Don't let any of this make you feel inadequate, some of these flights lasted only weeks.
[^2]: Transmission and radio are far more complex than I understand, but the metaphor works for this post.
[^3]: I don't say buying cause that feels more simplistic and "completed" to me. We are still *very much* in debt.
