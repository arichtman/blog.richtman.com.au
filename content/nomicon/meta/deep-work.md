# Deep Work

Summary of Deep Work's second section, _The Rules_.

There's value in both isolation for focus and collaboration for ideas and diversity.
Building design can support both or none of these, but without balance it's suboptimal.
Successful designs use transit corridors as "hubs" for interaction, but keep the "spokes" as areas for voluntary isolation and focus.

Isolation operates on a spectrum, some take months in total isolation, others sip small spurts daily.
Some eschew all contact including phone and email, others limit it to physical mail and only handle it quarterly.
One approach to ensure consistency is simple, visible, habits tracking.
The aim becomes not to break the streak, nothing more.
Some people can shift gears rapidly and consistently enough to capitalise ad-hoc on time afforded.
You are probably not one of them.
Yet.
Depends on personality, practical requirements, and the type of work.

As with habits generally, it's recommended to stick to any rules or routine you set.
Your willpower, focus intensity, and focus duration are likely shot worse than you think.
Novices may only be capable of 1 hour of focussed practice per day, experts up to but not more than 5.

> Think like an artist, work like an accountant.

The grand guesture is another approach to catalysing deep work.
The idea is that such a public, expensive, or dramatic committment spurrs you into focus.
Mostly though this is realized as a change of scenery (and the accompanying distance from distractions).

Clayton Christensen wrote _The 4 Diciplines of Execution_ (4DX)

1. *Focus on the wildly important.*
   The more you try to do the less you actually accomplish.
   Basically don't try to boil the ocean.
1. *Act on lead measures.*
   Lag measures most closely follow and verify outcomes.
   However they respond too slowly to influence behaviour or motivate.
   Find a suitable proxy that's leading and measure that.
   The most rudimentary one is hours of deep work on this goal.
1. *Keep a compelling scoreboard.*
   Track your progress against goals and objectives.
1. *Create a cadence of accountability.*
   Report on progress, regularly and publicly.

When tracking focussed hours, try circling the hours where a finite quanta of work is finished, an objective is achieved, or a breakthrough was made.
This allows some rough estimation of duration-to-work as well as motivates.
This of course does not really fly for the public accountability aspect in a business context.
There outcomes are prioritized well over effort.

Don't fight against boredom or laziness, rather time-box them and indeed ensure they happen.
There's human requirements for non-work time and non-focus time.
Don't burn yourself out.

In some cases the subconscious will work through an issue better than you could consciously.
Take advantage of this by putting something down when it's a struggle and return to it later.

Doing mindless, low intensity exercise can improve your performance later.
One can also actively reason about problems during, just mind looping and distractions.

The end of the workday should be the *end of the work*.
Use a ritual, lock the laptop, whatever it needs to be to ensure no more work intrudes after you finish.
That includes ruminations and research.

One helpful ritual is:

1. Take stock of all outstanding tasks, ensure they're in the appropriate queues
1. Final email sweep, anything urgent gets a reply, nothing else
1. Review tomorrow's calendar and plan deep work spots
1. Shutdown ritual, use a phrase, habit, food or drink, candle, whatever, just officially close it off
