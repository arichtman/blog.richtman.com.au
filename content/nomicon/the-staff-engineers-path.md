# The Staff Engineer's Path

I've marked chapters here but I'm not sure I'll keep them.
This isn't cliff's, it's supposed to be a summary for ME to refer to.

## Introduction

Based on a foundation of _technical knowledge and experience_,
we use the 3 capabilities of _big-picture thinking_, _project execution_, and _levelling up_
to create _impactful outcomes_ that drive the organization in the direction it wants to go.

Big-picture thinking I relate to systems thinking, but you do have to see beyond, whether that's long term timewise, or relationships, or other politics, or timing.
Project execution isn't project managemnt, but you do have to be able to take somrthing and run with it through to success.
Levelling up was a bit wishy but it's not quite as narrow as upskilling since there's more soft influence and culture here.

## Chapter one

Companies and individuals within them may want (or not!) staff engineers for varying reasons.
Leaders often want someone who can take a holistic view, work cross-team and technically to facilitate delivery independently.
There's also an element of glue, for everything that falls in the grey area between teams, responsibilities, architectures, and even just capacity.

Teams may locally maximise, or defer to their manager for all ownership, or outsource by sending everything higher.
Project managers, even technical ones, are more incentivised to deliver, than to think about non-functional aspects, or day 2 operations, or debt and future iterations, or retirement.
TPMs are also very much not expected to spelunk code or hash out very gritty details.

Staffies are also supposed to influence positively, uplift skills, and champion culture.
I think a lot of this comes with and salient role or leadership position, though it's worth highlighting as ICs may not be quite aware of how many eyes will be on them.
