# Ariel Richtman blog

Contains Hugo + content for my blog

## Authoring

```bash
hugo new content/posts/full-sentence-lower-case-title.md
```

## Current issues

- DevContainer not running VSCode extensions due to some clash between workspace and container (This extension is disabled in this workspace because it is defined to run in the Remote Extension Host. Please install the extension in 'Dev Container: Hugo' to enable.)
- Code backticks render funny, code blocks OK, find a new theme?
